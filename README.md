# Discord data analysis

Gives you some CSVs to look at how much you wasted your life on this goddamn website. Simply put this script in the root folder of your discord data dump (i.e. the folder with `README.txt` in it) and run it !

It will give you :
* Messages per month
* Meows per month :3 :3 nyaaaaa~
* Messages sent in DMs vs. Messages sent in servers counts
* Messages sent per server
* Messages sent per person / DM group
* Messages sent per month AND per server in the same table ? Satisfactory.
* Same as previous point but for DMs

Note : Deleted servers won't be accounted for, fortunately (that would mean discord kept all the data about deleted servers which would suck mad balls). Deleted users and group chats will be accounted as "Unknown Participant" or "Others".
